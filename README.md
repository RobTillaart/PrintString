# PrintString

Arduino library to print to a String.


## Description

PrintString is a class that buffers a number of print statements in a String.
This String can be requested to process later.

- buffer slowly generated data, and send it with minimum time between bytes
  e.g. to maximize packets for Ethernet.
- print to buffer to see how many chars the output is;
  use to prevent "display line overflow"
  (e.g. floats)

- https://github.com/RobTillaart/PrintCharArray (captures data in a char buffer)
- https://github.com/RobTillaart/PrintSize (counts length of a number of print commands)
- https://github.com/RobTillaart/PrintString (captures data in a String)


## Interface

```cpp
#include "PrintString.h"
```

- **PrintString()** constructor.
- **size_t write(uint8_t c)** workhorse I of Print interface.
- **size_t write(uint8_t \* str, uint8_t length)** workhorse II of Print interface.
- **void clear()** wipes the internal String buffer
- **int size()** current usage of the buffer.
- **String getString()** to access the buffer.


## Operational

See examples.


## Future

#### Must

- documentation

#### Should

- testing
- examples
  - add new ones
  - rename examples
- add functions like **repeat(char c)** to inject e.g. 7 spaces etc.
- add error flag

#### Could

- PRINTSTRING_LIB_VERSION

#### Wont
